# My Dotfiles

Note: If you use WSL2, checkout the WSL2 branch. It has my old setup including plenty of workarounds for everything such as fluid copy pasting between vim and windows.

### Intro
_Turbocharge your vim into an IDE with 550 lines of config. Make your terminal the envy of the entire town with only a few minutes of setup._

Wondering about what features my Vim config has? Any feature you find useful in whatever IDE or other program you use, **my config has it and more**. Are you a neovim user? Fear not! my config has even more features for you to take advantage of!

A short list:

* Persistent undo
* Better autocomplete than VSCode
* floating and inline function documentation and parameter completion (and other goodies!)
* Auto-save
* Persistent sessions
* support for any of many dozens of colorschemes
* An all-in-one editor for (literally) **any** programming language, markdown, latex, and more.
* A start screen with bookmarks to your recent files/favorites
* An aesthetic colorscheme (actually one of [several dozen](https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes) that you can pick and choose from), tabline, and statusline
* Super easy tab, split, and buffer navigation
* File explorer and file overview (see picture)
* Git integration
* Fuzzy file searching
* A myriad of quality of life features you will not be able to live without
* Highly Customizable. I have customized nearly everything, which means you get a template for your own customizations :) 

If my config does not have a feature you want, (it will), make an issue, and I will add it if I think it would be useful.

### Installation

I would recommend taking parts of code you like from the stars of the show, my [vim/nvim](https://github.com/pgosar/useful-things/tree/main/dotfiles/config/vim-nvim/) settings, my [tmux](https://github.com/pgosar/useful-things/tree/main/dotfiles/config/tmux.conf) settings, and my [terminal](https://github.com/pgosar/useful-things/tree/main/dotfiles/config/shells) settings, which you are probably here for.
If you go the ```git clone``` route, you can also symlink my files to your own configuration files using
``` python
ln ~/dotfiles/dotfiles/config/vim-nvim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
for example. This creates what is basically a new file with the exact same content as the one in this repository. If you run into any issues in using my files, feel free to make an issue. I have probably run into the same issue before too.

My terminal configurations are dependent on files located [here](https://github.com/pgosar/useful-things/tree/main/dotfiles/other). You are welcome to copy those files anywhere you want.
<hr />

### Dependencies
My vimrc requires [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). Look at its README for details on usage. Refer to [CoC's README](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) for details on using the LSP provider.

zsh requires [powerline](powerline/powerline) with the [Meslo nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) and [oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)

fish requires [tide](https://github.com/ilanCosman/tide)

tmux requires [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)

You can refer to the repositories linked above for download instructions, and be sure to give them your support!

### Warning

There are a couple system specific settings and a couple hard coded filepaths in here that are possibly useless to you. As always, be sure to look through the code you are planning on using and remove/change unnecessary lines.

### A note about migrating to Lua

Eventually I will be moving to a Lua only config for Neovim (hopefully within the coming months), with the exception that all my keybindings will be written in vimscript and then sourced in my init.lua. As such, when that happens, my vimrc will NOT be updated to vim9 script, and will stop recieving updates as new possible improvements/features to my config become available. 

Part of this is my desire to use a language for my (n)Vim tinkering that actually has a usecase beyond Vim and also partly because any performance improvements in vim9 compared to LuaJIT still do not make using vimscript a more enticing proposition than Lua. I am considering becoming more involved in writing plugins and more extensive modifications for my neovim as the need arises (provided I have time), and I most definitely would prefer using Lua for that instead of vim9 script. That being said, the Vim config will remain here, be completely usable, and will still provide an IDE-like experience. 

Contributions are, as always, welcome if anybody plans to port parts of my vim config (or all of it, I certainly wouldn't complain!) to vim9 and wants to share their work. In this case, it would be best to make a separate file so that I can maintain backwards compatibility and provide a version of my config that works for people not planning to use vim9 script.

### Contributing
I welcome contributions if you know of any useful features that I may be
missing, as well as help making the files more plug and play friendly by
limiting the number of hard coded filepaths and helping to create a small shell
script to automate creating symlinks during installation. I unfortunately do not
have the time to do so currently.
