### Intro
_Turbocharge your vim into an IDE with 550 lines of config. Make your terminal the envy of the entire town with only a few minutes of setup._

Wondering about what features my Vim config has? Any feature you find useful in whatever IDE or other program you use, **my config has it and more**. Are you a neovim user? Fear not! my config has even more features for you to take advantage of!

A short list:

* Persistent undo
* Better autocomplete than VSCode
* floating and inline function documentation and parameter completion (and other goodies!)
* Auto-save
* Persistent sessions
* support for any of many dozens of colorschemes
* An all-in-one editor for (literally) **any** programming language, markdown, latex, and more.
* A start screen with bookmarks to your recent files/favorites
* An aesthetic colorscheme (actually one of [several dozen](https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes) that you can pick and choose from), tabline, and statusline
* Super easy tab, split, and buffer navigation
* File explorer and file overview (see picture)
* Git integration
* Fuzzy file searching
* A myriad of quality of life features you will not be able to live without
* Highly Customizable. I have customized nearly everything, which means you get a template for your own customizations :) 

If my config does not have a feature you want, (it will), make an issue, and I will add it if I think it would be useful.

### Installation

For now, if you want to install my files you have to clone the respository with 

``` bash

git clone https://github.com/pgosar/dotfiles.git

```


### Dependencies
My vimrc requires [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). Look at its README for details on usage. Refer to [CoC's README](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) for details on using the LSP provider.
